Sandra Voelker scooped her fifth gold medal and anchored a German relay to a world best time on the final day of the European sprints and short-course championships on Sunday.
But the four-day meeting ended on a controversial note when Britain's Susan Rolph found she would not go into the record books after matching the fastest short-course swim by a European in the women's 200 metres individual medley.
Rolph, who won the 100 individual medley on Saturday, claimed her second gold in the 200 medley in two minutes 10.60 seconds to equal the time swum by East German Petra Schneider in Gainesville, Florida, in January 1982.
But when Schneider swam there were no official European records for the short-course races and the East German's mark officially ranks as a "standard time" which must be bettered before a record is recognised.
Rolph's "consolation" was a leather coat awarded by the sponsors for the best performance by a woman swimmer in the championships.
Voelker, who set European records in the 100 and 50 freestyle on Friday and Saturday, claimed her third individual gold in the 50 backstroke, winning in 27.94 seconds from fellow German Antje Buschschulte (28.55).
The two later teamed up with Sylvia Gerasch and Julia Voitowitsch to win the women's 4x50 medley relay in 1:51.79, beating the previous world best of 1:52.44 set by another German quartet in Espoo, Finland, in November 1992.
Voelker's other gold came in Friday's 4x50 freestyle relay.
Hosts Germany finished top of the medals table, taking 14 of the 38 titles at stake.
Big Dutchman Marcel Wouda matched Voelker as the only other swimmer to win three individual titles.
Wouda completed a Rostock individual medley treble by winning the 400 event in a personal best 4:08.90, more than four seconds ahead of second-placed German Christian Keller. "I think I'm dreaming," he said.
Britain's Mark Foster wrapped up an impressive sprint double, speeding away with the men's 50 metres freestyle title.
Foster, winner of Saturday's 50 butterfly, qualified only third in the morning's heats but proved fastest when it really mattered.
Foster, 50 freestyle world short-course champion in 1993, showed clearly ahead when he arrowed out of the turn and won in 22.25 from Rene Gusperti of Italy (22.51) and Dmitry Kalinovsky of Belarus ( 22.57).
Spain's Barbara Franco brought Johanna Sjoberg's winning streak to an end by beating the 18-year-old Swede in the women's 200 metres butterfly.
Sjoberg set European records in winning the 50 and 100 butterfly on Friday and Saturday but just failed to complete the treble.
Sjoberg led clearly for the first six lengths of the eight-length race but had to settle for silver as Florida-based Franco hit back in the final 50 metres, caught the Swede with one length to go and pulled away to win Spain's first women's senior international championship title.
Franco clocked 2:10.20, with Sjoberg second in 2:10.92.
Vera Lischka claimed Austria's first international swimming championship title by winning the women's 50 breaststroke in 31.36 ahead of Terrie Miller of Norway, reversing the order of Friday's 100 breaststroke.
